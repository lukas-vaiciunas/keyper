## INFO
Keyper is an infinite, procedurally generated, perma-death, turn-based roguelike/roguelite developed in 72 hours for [Mini Jam 98](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-98-empty).

The game engine was developed in C++ using the [Allegro 5 multimedia library](https://liballeg.org/).

## HOW TO PLAY
Keyper's gameplay features an infinite amount of procedurally generated levels which increase in difficulty as the game progresses.

In each level the player must collect three keys: the red key, the green key, and the blue key. Upon completing this task, the exit to the next level will become available.

If the player is slain by one of the Keypers (the red enemies), it's game over.

Your enemies move once for every two times you move, so plan your movements ahead of time!
